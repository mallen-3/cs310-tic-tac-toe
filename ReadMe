This is the readme file for the Tic-Tac-Toe game that I did back when I was in CS310 with Dr. Snellen and learning all the stuff that we learned in the class. 
It was a file game that we had to dsign and build off the world classic tic-tac-toe game that has been played for a very long time all around the world 
in other countries and cultures. The game file itself was broken into many different section that we had to build off of and had to make sure that the worked
properly as a team. It was divided up in the gameboard, the X and O characters, the different player modules, and the many different ways that you could possibly 
get the win against the opponent or somehow wind up in a tie which actually does happen more than you think. We worked in a team of three students and we were assigned 
different parts of the game and then when we met up we would look at each others code and try to help out if somebody else was having a problem or just wanted
someone to double check there work for them. It was very fun and neat to do it because we all got a whole lot more experience learning how to code better
and how we almost never wanted to look at Tic-Tac-Toe the same way again.
